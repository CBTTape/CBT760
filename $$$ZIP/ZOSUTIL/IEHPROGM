Yes, it still works but more people create a mess than fix one.
Which is probably why you are looking to use this. Stop digging
yourself into a deeper hole and find a better way.


IEHPROGM is a system utility that is used to modify system control data
and to maintain data sets at an organizational level. IEHPROGM should
only be used by those programmers who are locally authorized to do so.

IEHPROGM does not support dynamic UCBs while processing data sets that
are password-protected.

You can use IEHPROGM to perform the following tasks:

x) Scratch (delete) a data set or a member of a partitioned data set.
x) Rename a data set or a member of a partitioned data set.
x) Maintain data set passwords.

   A SECURITY PACKAGE IS A BETTER WAY TO PROTECT ACCESS THAN PASSWORDS.


You must have RACF authority in order to use IEHPROGM. For information
on RACF requirements for the Storage Management Subsystem, see z/OS
DFSMSdfp Storage Administration Reference.


IDCAMS is recommended for use with SMS managed data sets. For
information on IDCAMS, see z/OS DFSMS Access Method Services.


You can write an assembler program to perform any of the IEHPROGM
functions. See z/OS DFSMSdfp Advanced Services and z/OS DFSMS: Using
Data Sets.

Example 1: Scratch Temporary System Data Sets

In this example, all temporary system data sets are scratched from the
volume table of contents.

/*

The control statements are discussed below:

x) The DD2 statement defines a volume. Because the system residence
   volume is not referred to, a DD statement is needed to define it.

x) The SCRATCH statement, with SYS specified, indicates that all
   temporary system data sets whose expiration dates have expired are
   scratched from the specified volume.

Example 2: Scratch and Uncatalog Two Data Sets

In this example, two data sets are scratched: SET1 and A.B.C.D.E are
scratched from volume 222222. Both data sets are uncataloged.

Example 3: Rename a Multi-Volume Data Set Catalog

In this example, the name of a data set is changed on two mountable
volumes. The old data set name is removed and the data set is cataloged
under its new data set name.

The control statements are discussed below:

x) RENAME specifies that data set A.B.C, which resides on volumes
   222222 and 333333, is to be renamed NEWSET.

x) UNCATLG specifies that data set A.B.C is uncataloged.

A SECURITY PACKAGE IS A BETTER WAY TO PROTECT ACCESS THAN PASSWORDS.

Example 5: Rename a Data Set and Define New Passwords

In this example, a data set is renamed. The data set passwords assigned
to the old data set name are deleted. Then two passwords are assigned
to the new data set name. If the data set is not cataloged, a message
is issued indicating that the LOCATE macro instruction ended
unsuccessfully.

               DATA='ASSIGNED TO J. DOE'
/*

The utility control statements are discussed below:

x) RENAME specifies that the data set called OLD is renamed NEW. The
   operator is required to supply a password to rename the old data set.

x) DELETEP specifies that the entry for the password KEY is deleted.
   Because KEY is a control password in this example, all the password
   entries for the data set name are deleted. The VOL parameter is not
   needed because the protection status of the data set as set in the
   DSCB is not to be changed; read/write protection is presently set in
   the DSCB, and read/write protection is desired when the passwords are
   reassigned under the new data set name.

x) The ADD statements specify that entries are added for passwords KEY
   and READ. KEY becomes the control password and allows both read and
   write access to the data set. READ becomes a secondary password and
   allows only read access to the data set. The VOL parameter is not
   needed, because the protection status of the data set is still set in
   the DSCB.

Example 6: List and Replace Password Information

In this example, information from a password entry is listed. Then the
protection mode of the password, the protection status of the data set,
and the user data are changed.

//REPLPASS JOB ...
//STEP1   EXEC PGM=IEHPROGM,PARM='NOPRINT'
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*

               DATA='NO SECONDARIES; ASSIGNED TO DEPT 31'
/*

The utility control statements are discussed below:

x) LIST specifies that the access counter, protection mode, and user
   data from the entry for password ABLE are listed. Listing the entry
   permits the content of the access counter to be recorded before the
   counter is reset to zero by the REPLACE statement.

x) REPLACE specifies that the protection mode of password ABLE is to be
   changed to allow both read and write access and that the protection
   status of the data set is changed to write-only protection. The VOL
   parameter is required because the protection status of the data set
   is changed and the data set, in this example, is not cataloged.
   Because this is a control password, the CPASWORD parameter is not
   required.

Example 7: Rename a Partitioned Data Set Member

/*

The control statements are discussed below:

x) DD1 DD defines a permanently mounted volume.

x) SYSIN DD defines the input data set, which follows in the input
   stream.

x) RENAME specifies that member ABC in the partitioned data set
   DATASET, which resides on a disk volume, is renamed BC.
