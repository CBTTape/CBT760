
This dataset (sub-directory) contains the beginning of a project to
have some useful samples showing how to use various utilities.

=======================================================================

The original concept was good, the design was left unassigned, the
contributions were few, and the bulk of the samples come from the
outdated UTILITIES manual. I have been updating them to work in
an SMS environment and with how z/OS works these days.

  Know how and where to look for samples and examples:

  - SYS1.SAMPLIB
  - Other products hlq.**.*samp
  - In manuals
      SC26-7414-02 z/OS DFSMSdfp Utilities
  - On the web (see below)

  Know the difference between a sample and an example.

  - A sample is complete code that worked somewhere at sometime.

  - An example is a theoretical snippet that may not work as shown
    and may never have ever been in any running code.

The organization (naming standards) of the members is still undergoing
a trial and error process to come up with a way to quickly identify
the utility and the purpose. I had been leaning towards many members,
using the first three characters of the utility name and up to five
characters to show a minor characteristic. Dan Denver, a co-worker,
shared his HSM hints member with me and I am now of the belief I should
have one member per component.

And even this design may change if I get around to writing the
%UTILITY edit macro to embed a utility STEP, similar to how the
MODEL command works.

On the web:
===========
In addition to making softcopy documents available on CD-ROM, IBM
provides access to unlicensed z/OS softcopy documents on the Internet.
To find z/OS documents on the Internet, first go to the z/OS home page:
http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos

Now in knowing how to look, start at the beginning:

On January 16th, 2007 I was able to navigate to books this way
http://www.ibm.com
(I was redirected to http://www.ibm.com/us)
Find the 'Products' link under the IBM logo
Find the 'system z (Mainframe)' link under Systems & Servers
Find the 'Operating systems' link under Mainframe servers
Find the /z/OS' link
Find the 'Library' link
Find the VxRy link for the level of the system you are using.
Find the Element or feature you need (MVS)

Brought me to:
http://www-03.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/bkserv/r7pdf/mvs.html
and for the JCL User's Guide:
http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/iea2b540.pdf
and under DFSMS for the DFSMSdfp Utilities Manual:
http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/dgt2u120.pdf

Since websites and their links change, it is more important to
know how to find them than to rely on a static link off some other
web site's page. Even the instructions above may now be out of date.
The point of having the instructions above is to show how one might
go about finding information.
