A throwback to when JCL and data was actually punched on a card. This
signalled when the end of a job was reached and the system could start
processing it. Eventually the system could tell the end of one job
when it saw another jobcard. Then when terminals came into vogue,
TSO and ISPF submits read until the end of file, which signalled the
end of a job. So, it is no longer required, wastes disk space, but
lets you keep JCL in the same member which is not processed.

Oh yeah, instead of deleting those last steps, just insert an EOJ
after the last statement you want as part of the job, then submit.
Voila`, the remaining JCL is not submitted and you still have it!
