A throwback to when a job could allocate the card reader for a ddname.
The 'Computer Operator' would get a prompt on the console to load
data into the card reader. Everything fed into the card reader was
processed as data until the end-of-data card was read. This signalled
the end of the file. It was common to have a bunch of these laying
around. They were also handy in slipping them between a mounted
reel of tape (yeah, real tapes are round like your scotch tape
dispenser and are called 'reels') to fool the drive into thinking
the yellow write protect ring was in place for an output tape.
Pity the poor Operator that mounted the wrong reel and did this.

The two characters you specify using the DLM parameter. Useful if you
have instream data that contains the '/*' control card.
