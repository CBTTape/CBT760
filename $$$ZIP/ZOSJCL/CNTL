
//prefix.label   CNTL *               comments

Used in conjunction with the ENDCNTL statement for PSF.

prefix is optional and follows the same rules as label.
  It does not mean the same as a DD statement override.

label consists of 1 to 8 alphanumeric or national characters.
  label is usually coded as a printer-id, e.g. //PRT2 CNTL
  The first character must be alphabetic or a national character.
  Alphabetic = A through Z.
  Numeric = 0 through 9.
  National characters in the USA are @,#,$.

The asterisk is required if you code comments.


The CNTL statement terminates with the ENDCNTL statement. Things
in between look like JCL but are special control cards used by
the PSF subsystem.
