
/*SETUP

Back when there weren't so many messages going to consoles you could
use the /*SETUP control card to let the operator know what tape
volume serial numbers the job would need. Nowadays, too many messages
are produced for any HUMAN to reall read them and two other
technologies did away with this practice.

1) Use of catalogued data sets means no one wants to look up what
   VOLSESRs will be used and code them in JCL that job scheduling
   software is submitting.
2) Automated tape devices mount more tapes than people do, and they
   don't read console messages.
